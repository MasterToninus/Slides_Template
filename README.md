# Slides: Multisymplectic Reduction
60 minute talk about my work with Casey and Leonid.

Slides for a contributed talk at the [MPI-Oberseminar](https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/158).


Place: MPIM, Bonn, Germany
Date: 07/04/2022
Title: Symmetries and Reduction of Multisymplectic manifolds
Contents: Broad mathematical audience.
Lenght: 60 min


## TODO: possible improvements
- add a slide on normal forms and Darboux (take it from Leo's talk)
- Expand the explanation about our reduction. In particular, argue why the ingredients are constructed this way.
